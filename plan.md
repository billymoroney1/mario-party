## to do

add pictures or animation to center of board for:
    mario using item
    donkey kong using item
    mario gaining money
    mario losing money
    donkey kong gaining money
    donkey kong losing money
    mario not having enough money for item

make dk wait to move until you complete your choice to buy an item or star

change what shows in gameInfo box when it's time to hit move again

add some kind of 'minigame' (random event for now) that dictates money gained or lost in between turns. when implemented add gifs to center to explain result

make playerInfo text into pictures of some sort

change button on your move to 'Move', then change to 'roll dice'

when a character buys a star, randomly choose a new star spot

fine tune how players earn money so it's not obnoxious
