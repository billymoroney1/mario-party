## to do

can i put some kind of gif thing in the middle of the board based on what action is happening

make chooseItem function

what can items do?

how display items to choose from in gameInfo panel?

how limit game to x amount of turns

there's just some issue where if both players are moving at once it fucks with the style and positioning 

haven't really been able to test items, stars, and end game

donkey kong moves before waiting for user to pick whether to buy a star or item if they land on star or store squares
