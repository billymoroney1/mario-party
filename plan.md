## to do

add pictures or animation to center of board for:
    computer buying star
    computer buying item
    mario using item
    donkey kong using item
    mario gaining money
    mario losing money
    donkey kong gaining money
    donkey kong losing money

make dk wait to move until you complete your choice to buy an item or star

change what shows in gameInfo box when it's time to hit move again

make 'your move options disappear until computer is done moving'

add some kind of 'minigame' (random event for now) that dictates money gained or lost in between turns. when implemented add gifs to center to explain result

make it visually clear when donkey kong buys item and star?

make playerInfo text into pictures of some sort

change button on your move to 'Move', then change to 'roll dice'

when a character buys a star, randomly choose a new star spot

fine tune how players earn money so it's not obnoxious
