## to do
retriggering move() after pausing to check a square is causing some wonky shit

fix star and store check functions to happen automatically on computer turn?
is there an issue where my global position function is preventing proper functionality?
create a computer player and have them roll dice after the player takes a turn

make chooseItem function

what can items do?

how display items to choose from in gameInfo panel?

how limit game to x amount of turns

why do i keep having this game loop problem? what makes a game loop not run forever?

there's just some issue where if both players are moving at once it fucks with the style and positioning 

is there a bug when player rolls 0

haven't really been able to test items, stars, and end game
