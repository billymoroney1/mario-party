## to do

create a computer player and have them roll dice after the player takes a turn

create functions that randomly assign styling/functionality to random squares
create function that randomly chooses a spot for the star
make the logic that tests the square a player lands on, and if they pass a star, prompts them to buy it
for now start with 20 turns before calculate a winner
