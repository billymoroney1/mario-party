## to do
dice roll + moving images through board
put info in the center of the screen that contains the money each player has
create functions that randomly assign styling/functionality to random squares
create function that randomly chooses a spot for the star
make a div for the dice
make the logic that tests the square a player lands on, and if they pass a star, prompts them to buy it
for now start with 20 turns before calculate a winner
