## to do

can i put some kind of gif thing in the middle of the board based on what action is happening

there's just some issue where if both players are moving at once it fucks with the style and positioning 

animation of character bumping dice

put inventory in each player box

get picture of green shell to replace background color

add some kind of 'minigame' (random event for now) that dictates money gained or lost in between turns

add magic lamp

make it visually clear when donkey kong buys item and star?
