## to do
dice roll + moving images through board (add class to change styling so that squares transfer an image?)
put info in the center of the screen that contains the money each player has
create functions that randomly assign styling/functionality to random squares
create function that randomly chooses a spot for the star
make a div for the dice
make the logic that tests the square a player lands on, and if they pass a star, prompts them to buy it
for now start with 20 turns before calculate a winner
